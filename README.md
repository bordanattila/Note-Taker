# Note Taker

## Description

The application allow the user to use the browser to take notes. The notes are stored on a server. Notes can be added and deleted when become obsolete. 
This application can help users to take notes that less likely to be lost and avoid the piling up of post it notes. Furthermore, the notes can be accessed from any computer with an internte connection. 
While building the application I was able to gain a deeper understanding of modularizing various routes and connecting the frontend with the backend.
